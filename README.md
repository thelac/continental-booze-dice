* Sharing drinks is allowed (Continental Rules - see alternative Chattanooga Hooch Dice Rules)
* People who are out can contribute drinks
* You can take a shot to add or decrement value of an exact call before roll is resolved
* Simple majority of active players can take shot to implement new rule
* If all dice are the same (counting wilds) everyone drinks
* Third party buybacks are single opt-in
* Someone who's out can take a shot and roll a die at any time before a turn resolves
* First person to surrender a die takes two shots
* Ian's Rule: at any time while a player is deciding their call, Ian Chang may call bullshit to take control of the call and turn
